- Background color: Very light blue (#E5EAF7) to provide a clean, non-distracting backdrop.
- Accent color: Complementary orange (#FF9829) for call-to-action buttons and important links.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, will be used throughout the site, for both headlines and body text. It's modern, neutral, and highly readable.
- Use clear and recognizable icons to represent different driving-related services.
- Responsive design with clear sections for each type of information. Use white space effectively to prevent a cluttered feel.
- Subtle animations to highlight important elements or guide the user through the website. Example: a fade-in effect as content loads.
